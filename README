License to Journey is an experiment in ActionScript 3.
It attempts to recreate the classic board game Ticket to Ride.

It is currently unfinished. Most of the game has been recreated, except for the scoring. 
There is almost no error checking in the current version. So if you don't know the rules
to the game, you'll be lost. You are able to make moves that are illegal and that will
crash the game.

Feel free to fork and extend and improve the project, I'll be happy to merge any changes.

The position of the cities is matched to the actual Ticket to Ride board. For copyright
reasons I wasn't able to include it, but it should be fairly simple to replace the assets
with the original ones and get the almost real deal.
